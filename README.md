# Rental-Car-Database-Project

I created this project for Lehigh University CSE 241 Database Project Rent-A-Car

Please Note: The project was created using Net Beans.

===========================================================

In the dist folder there is runnable jar file to validate the working of the application. The jar application will promt username and password and you will have to use the following:

username: admin
password: iamadmin

=============================================================

ER Digram was made using Microsoft Visio, which we also used in the CSB 311 class. There is a converted pdf version but that version does not show the links between entities.

=============================================================

I used phpMyAdmin; free software tool MariaDB server and very easy to use. There is available tutorial online. https://www.phpmyadmin.net/
MySQL is very similar to Oracle and maintains all SQL rules.
