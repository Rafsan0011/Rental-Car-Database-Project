Cannot connect to Oracle Developer from off campus location, and also I forgot my Oracle password. I used phpMyAdmin; free software tool MariaDB server and very easy to use. There is available tutorial online. https://www.phpmyadmin.net/
MySQL is very similar to Oracle and maintains all SQL rules. I'm also working on our CSE website project with Professor Brian Davison where I'm working with mysql so it was convenient for me over oracle sql aswell.
